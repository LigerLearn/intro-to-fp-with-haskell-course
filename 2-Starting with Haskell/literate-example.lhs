In a literate Haskell file, comments are the default!
If you want to write code you need to begin the line
with a greater than symbol, '>', like so:

> hello :: String
> hello = "hello!"

All lines which do not begin with a '>' are ignored.
The point is to encourage comments and documentation
so that the code can be read like reading an essay!
